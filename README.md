# Capstone---PGA-Tour-Analysis
Coursera Capstone - Final Project

This is the repository for my Capstone Project.

Please note - Instead of using foursquare data, I drew inspiration from the sample report shown on Coursera - Predicting NBA players improvement.
Along a smilar vein, my report will be looking at PGA Tour data, and will be trying to pick out elite golfers based on tour stats.

Initial submission contains only a Description of the problem, and a Description of the data.

Hope you enjoy! Thanks
